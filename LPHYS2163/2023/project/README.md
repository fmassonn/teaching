# LPHYS2163 Project #2
## How geostrophic is the real wind?

Here are the instructions for the second project of LPHYS2163.

### Objective 1. Producing the map of a variable

This first task is a technical one and ensures that you will have familiarized yourselves with basic tools. The preferred language for coding is python but alternatives are of course acccepted.

Your objective is to plot a map of the geopotential (in m$^2$/s$^2$) of the atmosphere at the 500 hPa level, on the 1st of December 2022 at 12:00 UTC. 

The data is already available in NetCDF format in the folder ./data
